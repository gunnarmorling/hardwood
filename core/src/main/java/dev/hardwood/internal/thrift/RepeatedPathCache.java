/// 100,000 columns and ten row groups, a million paths of which only 100,000 are distinct, each
/// otherwise costing a `String`, its bytes, a list and a `FieldPath`.
///
/// The cache is keyed by position, the way [dev.hardwood.internal.reader.Dictionary] keys its
/// interned strings by dictionary index: chunks appear in schema order within a row group, so
/// the n-th path of one row group is the n-th path of the next. That is a convention rather
/// than a rule the format enforces, so it is a **prediction**, checked by comparing the cached
/// entry against the encoded bytes about to be read — a hit skips the decode entirely, a miss
/// decodes and re-primes that position. Content-keyed interning was measured against this and
/// lost: hashing every path and probing a table of them costs more than the allocation it saves.
